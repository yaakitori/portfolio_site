## Build & Deploy

This site uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) via the Play CDN and is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

### Local development

Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step is required.

### Deployment

Any push to the `master` branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` which publishes the site to the `gh-pages` branch and makes it available at the URL above.
